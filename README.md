# KONORKESTRA

### Dynamic Configuration & Health Monitoring for Distributed Systems

---

## Overview

**KONORKESTRA** is a distributed system that manages dynamic configuration and monitors node health across large-scale, heterogeneous infrastructures. It empowers administrators to define and manage configuration groups, ensures reliable and flexible propagation of updates to all participating nodes, and provides deep visibility into system health through real-time heartbeat monitoring.

---

## Core Concepts

### 1. Group-Based Configuration Management
- Admins create **configuration groups**, each containing a defined set of key-value settings.
- Each group is identified by a **secret key**, used by nodes to join and synchronize configurations.
- Configurations can be centrally updated and are automatically propagated to all participating nodes.

### 2. Consistency Models
KONORKESTRA supports two consistency models for configuration updates:

- **Strong Consistency**: Updates are only committed after **all nodes acknowledge** them.
- **Eventual Consistency**: Updates are committed once a **quorum of live nodes** (dynamically calculated) acknowledge the change.

### 3. Dynamic Configuration Reactivity
- Applications can **react dynamically** to configuration changes.
- Developers define **custom logic** (e.g., reload, restart, reinitialize) to safely handle updates.
- This provides **fine-grained, process-level control** without enforcing unsafe automatic updates.

---

## Node Lifecycle

- **Join**: A node joins a configuration group using a secret key.
- **Sync**: The node retrieves the latest configuration and checks for consistency.
- **Operate**: The node runs with the current configuration and monitors for updates.
- **React**: On configuration change, the application executes developer-defined logic.

---

## Node Health Monitoring

- Each node runs a **heartbeat client** that periodically signals liveness.
- Heartbeats are collected and analyzed in real time by the central system.
- Nodes that fail to send heartbeats are marked as **offline**.
- Health data is used to:
  - **Adjust quorum thresholds** dynamically
  - Provide **infrastructure insights** (cloud vs. on-prem)
  - **Detect anomalies** and support alerting systems

---

## Central System Functions

- **Admin Interface**: Allows configuration creation, updates, and monitoring.
- **Update Engine**: Propagates configuration changes and enforces consistency models.
- **Liveness Service**: Tracks node health and informs quorum-based decisions.
- **Analytics Engine**: Stores and analyzes heartbeat data to assess system health.

---

## Key Principles

- **Declarative Configuration**: Admins define the desired state; the system ensures convergence.
- **Loose Coupling**: Applications decide how to respond to config changes.
- **Observability First**: All configuration and health data is traceable and visible.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Built to integrate with cloud, on-prem, and hybrid systems.

## Why KONORKESTRA?

- Centralized configuration control, decentralized execution logic.
- Seamless integration with both legacy and modern systems.
- Safe, developer-driven response to configuration changes.
- Real-time health visibility and infrastructure insights at scale.
