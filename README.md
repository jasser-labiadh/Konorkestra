# KONORKESTRA

## Dynamic Configuration & Health Monitoring for Distributed Systems

### Overview

KONORKESTRA is a distributed system designed for **dynamic configuration management** and **health monitoring** across large-scale, heterogeneous infrastructures. It allows administrators to define and manage configuration groups, ensures the reliable and flexible propagation of updates to all participating nodes, and provides real-time heartbeat monitoring to track system health and node liveness.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Group-Based Configuration Management
- Admins create configuration groups, each containing a set of key-value settings.
- Each group is identified by a secret key, used by nodes to join and synchronize configurations.
- Configurations can be centrally updated and are automatically propagated to all participating nodes.

### 2. Consistency Models

KONORKESTRA supports two consistency models for configuration updates:
- **Strong Consistency**: Updates are only committed once all nodes acknowledge them.
- **Eventual Consistency**: Updates are committed once a quorum of live nodes (dynamically calculated) acknowledges the change.

### 3. Dynamic Configuration Reactivity
- Applications can react dynamically to configuration changes.
- Developers define custom logic (e.g., reload, restart, reinitialize) to handle updates safely.
- Fine-grained, process-level control is provided, avoiding unsafe automatic updates.

## Node Lifecycle

1. **Join**: A node joins a configuration group using a secret key.
2. **Sync**: The node retrieves the latest configuration and checks for consistency.
3. **Operate**: The node runs with the current configuration and monitors for updates.
4. **React**: On configuration change, the application executes developer-defined logic.

## Node Health Monitoring
- Each node runs a heartbeat client that periodically signals liveness.
- Heartbeats are collected and analyzed in real time by the central system.
- Nodes failing to send heartbeats are marked as offline.
- **Health data** is used to:
  - Adjust quorum thresholds dynamically.
  - Provide insights into infrastructure (cloud vs. on-prem).
  - Detect anomalies and support alerting systems.

## Central System Functions
1. **Admin Interface**: Allows configuration creation, updates, and monitoring.
2. **Update Engine**: Propagates configuration changes and enforces consistency models.
3. **Liveness Service**: Tracks node health and informs quorum-based decisions.
4. **Analytics Engine**: Stores and analyzes heartbeat data to assess system health.

---

## Key Principles
- **Declarative Configuration**: Admins define the desired state, and the system ensures convergence.
- **Loose Coupling**: Applications decide how to respond to configuration changes.
- **Observability First**: All configuration and health data is traceable and visible.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Built to integrate with cloud, on-prem, and hybrid systems.

## Why KONORKESTRA?
- **Centralized configuration control**, with decentralized execution logic.
- Seamless integration with both **legacy** and **modern systems**.
- Safe, **developer-driven** response to configuration changes.
- Real-time health visibility and **infrastructure insights** at scale.
