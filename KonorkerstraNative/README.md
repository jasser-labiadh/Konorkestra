Go Dynamic Configuration Synchronization

This Go component enables processes to synchronize their configurations dynamically with a central configuration daemon. It listens to configuration changes and notifies the processes with updates via callbacks.

Features
•	Process-specific Configuration Sync: Processes can register to receive configuration updates specific to them.
•	Callback-based Notifications: Processes pass a callback function to the Go library, which is called when a configuration change occurs.
•	Integration with Other Languages: While written in Go, this component is compatible with C libraries, allowing other processes in various languages to integrate easily.
•	Config Daemon Communication: Communicates with the central configuration daemon via Unix Domain Sockets (UDS).

Architecture Overview
1.	Central Configuration Daemon:
The configuration daemon running on each node handles the dynamic configuration and exposes a UDS server for communication.
2.	Go Library:
The Go component integrates with the configuration daemon and listens for configuration changes. When a change occurs, it checks which processes are affected and notifies them by calling the registered callback functions.
3.	Callback System:
Each process that needs configuration updates can register a callback function that will be called when the configuration changes. The callback is executed with the updated configuration data.
