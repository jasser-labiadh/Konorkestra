# Go Dynamic Configuration Synchronization

This Go component facilitates the dynamic synchronization of configurations across processes in a distributed system. It integrates with a central configuration daemon to propagate updates efficiently, allowing processes to respond to configuration changes in real-time.

## Features
- **Process-Specific Configuration Sync**: Each process can register to receive configuration updates tailored to its specific needs.
- **IPC-Based Notification System**: Instead of traditional callback mechanisms, this component offers a **named pipe (FIFO)** as an IPC mechanism to notify processes about configuration changes. This approach avoids memory management challenges often associated with callbacks, offering greater flexibility and scalability.
- **Cross-Language Compatibility**: While written in Go, this component communicates through **Unix Domain Sockets (UDS)** and can be easily integrated with processes in other languages such as C, Python, and Java, using native code interfaces.
- **Developer Flexibility**: Developers are provided with functions to:
  - **Get Updates**: Retrieve updated configuration values.
  - **Subscribe to Changes**: Register interest in configuration changes without dealing with memory issues or callbacks.
  - **Access Changed Configurations**: Efficiently query for the latest configuration or changes since the last sync.
  - **Monitor IPC**: Processes can use **OS-level concepts** like **named pipes (FIFOs)** or **eventfd** to monitor configuration changes. When a change is detected, the process can act accordingly, offering full control over handling updates.

## Architecture Overview

- **Central Configuration Daemon**: The configuration daemon runs on each node, handling dynamic configuration management. It exposes a UDS server for communication with processes, ensuring real-time configuration updates.
- **Go Library**: This component interacts with the configuration daemon, receiving and propagating updates via **IPC**. The Go library handles synchronization logic while giving developers the flexibility to manage configuration updates within their processes.
- **IPC Notification System**: The Go library implements **named pipes (FIFOs)** for inter-process communication. By utilizing OS-level facilities like **named pipes**, **eventfd**, or **inotify** (Linux), processes can subscribe to changes and monitor for updates in a lightweight, efficient manner.
- **System-Level Synchronization**: The Go library facilitates real-time updates and sync across processes, allowing them to react promptly when configurations change, using native OS-level functions. Developers can leverage the **named pipe (FIFO)** or **eventfd** mechanism to watch for changes without dealing with complex memory management or callback limitations.
